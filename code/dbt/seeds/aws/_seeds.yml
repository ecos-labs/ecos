    description: |
      Comprehensive mapping table for AWS EC2 instance family modernization and optimization recommendations.
      Provides upgrade paths from older instance families to current and latest generation instances across different processor architectures (Intel, AMD, Graviton).

      This mapping enables:
      - Instance modernization recommendations for cost optimization
      - Processor architecture migration analysis (Intel → AMD → Graviton)
      - Performance and cost comparison across instance generations
      - Automated rightsizing and modernization suggestions
      - Historical instance family lifecycle tracking

      Used by compute optimization models to identify modernization opportunities and calculate potential savings from upgrading to newer, more efficient instance types.

  - name: seed__aws_product_service_category
    description: |
      Authoritative mapping of AWS product codes to standardized service names and categories for consistent classification across cost analysis and optimization models. Provides human-readable service names and high-level categorization for AWS services.

      This mapping enables:
      - Consistent service naming and categorization across all models
      - Service-level cost aggregation and analysis
      - Service category-based reporting and dashboards
      - Standardized service classification for FinOps processes
      - Cross-model service identification and mapping

      Maintained as the single source of truth for AWS service categorization in the FinOps platform, ensuring consistent service classification across bronze, silver, and gold layer models.

  - name: seed__aws_regions
    description: |
      Comprehensive AWS region metadata including geographic coordinates, country information, and timezone data for location-based analysis, compliance reporting, and operational planning. Supports geographic cost analysis, data residency compliance, and regional optimization strategies.

      Key applications:
      - Geographic cost distribution analysis and visualization
      - Data residency and compliance reporting by country/region
      - Regional pricing and optimization analysis
      - Multi-region architecture cost modeling
      - Timezone-aware operational cost planning
      - Geographic proximity analysis for data transfer optimization

      Used by networking, compliance, and geographic analysis models to provide location context for cost optimization and operational decision making.
